# Progressive Loading

## Purpose

Installed PAW usage must load context progressively. A runtime adapter or human
operator should load the smallest authoritative set needed for the current
operation and expand only when the task demands it.

This preserves reviewability and prevents every PAW operation from loading the
entire repository context.

## Required Order

Use this order for Codex-oriented installed use:

1. Entrypoint and repository index: `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, and
   `AGENTS.md` or the target repository equivalent.
2. Relevant core contract under `paw/core/**`.
3. Current patch artifacts for the active operation.
4. Applicable catalog or preset under `paw/catalogs/**`.
5. Required adapter docs or runtime map, such as `.codex/README.md` and
   `.codex/paw-runtime-map.json`.
6. References, fixtures, test logs, and extended diagnostics only when a finding,
   failure, or human review requires them.

For explicit multi-runtime candidate evaluation, load only the runtime adapter
evidence for the selected runtime under `paw/adoption/adapters/runtime/`.
Claude Code evidence may point to official `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
semantics, repo-local `.claude/**` physical files, and the manual runtime
validation recorded by `paw-10f-runtime-validation-reconciliation`. Load those
physical files only for Claude Code candidate evaluation or later `paw-10e`
distribution work. For Claude Code plugin distribution evaluation, load
`paw/distribution/claude-code-plugin/paw/README.md` and `manifest.json` before
individual packaged skills or agents. Treat the staged plugin as
`distribution-files-candidate` unless official Claude Code plugin validation and
runtime discovery evidence is present.
Antigravity evidence must be loaded with its partial gaps visible and must not
be replaced with Gemini CLI assumptions. When `.agents/**` physical files are
present, load `.agents/skills/**`, `.agents/rules/**`, and
`.agents/workflows/**` as manually runtime-validated physical adapter candidate
evidence. For Antigravity distribution evaluation, load
`paw/distribution/antigravity-design-candidate.md` before assuming package files
exist. Treat Antigravity packaging as `distribution-design-candidate` only until
a successor governed patch confirms package path, metadata format, and runtime
install/discovery evidence.

## Runtime Requirements

Candidate runtime bindings must document which contract they load first and why.
They must not treat broad context loading as a substitute for routing,
artifact-state checks, or decision gates.

## Invalid Loading Patterns

The following patterns are invalid for default installed use:

- loading all `paw/**` documents before routing the operation;
- loading private `_inbox/**` material as runtime authority;
- treating fixtures or generated output as policy when a contract exists;
- loading adapters for runtimes that are not part of the current operation;
- treating candidate adapter evidence as proof of stable runtime support or
  plugin installation;
- using legacy `sdd/**` history to override live PAW contracts.

## Escalation

If a required document is missing, stale, or contradictory, the runtime must stop
and route to the appropriate drift or decision-gate workflow instead of loading
more unrelated context.
